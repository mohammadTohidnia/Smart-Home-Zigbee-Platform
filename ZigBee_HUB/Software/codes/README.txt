File "Connection Status" -> A python code for GPIO pins of Orange pi to control the led indicators for connection status.
This file is the final version and the code works fine.

File "Zig_to_tb" -> A python code to connect the zigbee network to thingsboard. You need the Access token of your device in this code.
The code works fine, but it is needed to get better. For example, we have to write a code that creates the hub as a device in thingsboard
automatically. In this way, there is no need to define access token for each device. For now, "zig_to_tb3" is better version that can
connect to thingsboard.
