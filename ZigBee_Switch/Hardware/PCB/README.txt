The final version is a zigbee InWall switch with one relay that connects to the Zigbee HUB. The proble is the dimensions of the PCB. 
We have to design a new PCB with other Power Supply that can convert 220 VAC to 5V DC in a small space. My solution is to use LNK306
switching regulator that offers a good output current for this circuit. The schematic is in this LInK : https://www.instructables.com/LNK304-Transformerless-Power-Supply/
The goal is to design a PCb less than 50 mm in dimensions.
